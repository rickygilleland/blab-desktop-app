Blab (formerly Watercooler) is an Electron app built in React and Typescript. It allowed remote teams to use always available voice and video rooms to comunicate instead of needing to create meetings.

Blab featured automatic face tracking powered by machine learning and a compact UI that would stay out of the way and let you focus on getting work done with your peers.
